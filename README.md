JWT_SECRET = 487def17ca241bb783ed1fdcb9ebc7ef21dd87d180bd40fc8b6fddb2e839110c
before running or else everything goes boom



Okay task we still need done 
we need to get the call system working 
we also need to get a way to save the white board and store them into a database 

next... I will also need to make the entire UI for the call screens as well as have them pop out 

lastly I will need to make the overall animation and design just better for the users




ALSO I want to make an actual landing page with animation 
LIKE HELLO USER.... go to home etc etc etc



wait maybe it would be cool if we can also use this site for plain note talking
video calling with a group of friends 
making chats and everything 
ik this isnt in the scope of this anymore but might as well 



add a username field
